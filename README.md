## About the Project

A program written in **Python 3** that simulates the **FIFO** (First In First Out) and **LRU** (Last Recently Used) page replacement algorithms as well as the **FCFS** (First Come First Served) and **SJF** (Shortest Job First) CPU time scheduling algorithms.

My random number **generators** allow to extract statistical data.

In the code I use **Object Oriented Programming** to store page and process objects.

You can find [documentation](#documentation) with code description and data analysis.
